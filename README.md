# RSPEC DEMO

One of the problems with Ruby on Rails is that it had so much "magic" that newcomers find it difficult to see where the magic ends and plain ruby begins. One of the early frameworks that often (at least in my experience) gets taught is RSPEC, and once again its another bundle of magic. This repo is meant to serve as a very basic example to show that rspec is its own thing, and something which can be played with separate to rails.

## How to use

1. bundle
2. rspec
3. observe the output (failing test)
4. inspect the code and see that is is just a single file which can test other arbitrary code
